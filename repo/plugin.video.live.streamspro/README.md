**Live Streams Pro +**, shamelessly a fork of a fork, livestreams originally developed by **divingmule** first and **Shani** later.
This can just do what Live Streams Pro could do, but with some new cool features, they are all listed in [Wiki Homepage](https://github.com/cttynul/plugin.video.live.streamspro/wiki)

If you are a developer **don't fork and rename** but, please, **open a [pull request](https://github.com/cttynul/plugin.video.live.streamspro/pulls)** if everything is working like a charm it will be accepted and I will credit you! 

This fork has been testend on **Kodi Leia 18.2**, btw it should work in any release (Isengard 15+).
